##Cite Stable Versions

Websites in general and blogs in particular are uisuited for citation in texts striving to provide reliable sources.
This is chiefly because content of a web-URL (to a blog post or wiki article) may be modified at any time.
The [Chymeric Photography Blog](http://photo.chymera.eu) provides a high degree of reliability as a citable source by backing up and versioning its entire content.

While we recommend viewing our content through our website for the best reading experience; we encourage citation of fixed versions via links to our repository in the reliable and stable GitHub service.
In this way your citation links will remain accessible whatever happens to our website, and the content they point to will always be fixed.

You can view a history of our updates by clicking the ["commits" link above](https://github.com/TheChymera/chymeric_photography/commits/master).
You may browse versions of each particular file by clicking through the file tree above.
Our actual articles are all under ```[/source/_posts/](https://github.com/TheChymera/chymeric_photography/tree/master/source/_posts)```.
